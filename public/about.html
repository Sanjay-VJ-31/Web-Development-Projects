    <h3>Hi, I’m Sanjay VJ</h3>
      
    <p>
      A curious mind driven by innovation, creativity, and a constant urge to learn and build. Whether it’s working on cutting-edge quantum circuits, designing efficient drone components, or exploring smart, sustainable solutions — I’m always diving into ideas that push the boundaries of what’s possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently pursuing a degree in Computer and Communication Engineering, I blend theoretical understanding with hands-on experimentation. My projects span across quantum computing, embedded systems, AI, and drone technologies — always with a goal to create solutions that are not just clever, but practical and impactful.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in learning by doing, collaborating with passionate people, and solving real-world challenges through technology. When I’m not experimenting with circuits or writing code, you’ll find me exploring new tech trends, sketching designs, or refining my next big idea.
